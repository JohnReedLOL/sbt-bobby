Bobby
=====

#Overview
This is an Sbt plugin that can be used to enforce (fail compilation) or warn when libraries and dependencies need to be upgraded.

#Background
'Bobby' is British slang for a police officer

It can be hard to ensure that distributed teams upgrade to the newest (mandatory) version of a library. Occasionally there may be security fixes or other reasons to require a library to be upgraded.
